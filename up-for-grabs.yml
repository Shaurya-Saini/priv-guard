  PrivGuard is a mobile-first privacy analysis app built with Flutter and on-device AI to detect oversharing and PII risks in digital content.
  Leveraging a fine-tuned DistilBERT NER model for text classification and TFLite inference for edge processing, it identifies sensitive entities such as names, dates, phone numbers, and financial details, generating a risk score (0â€“100) with contextual privacy suggestions.
  All analysis is performed locally with AES-encrypted storage, ensuring complete data privacy and zero cloud dependency.
